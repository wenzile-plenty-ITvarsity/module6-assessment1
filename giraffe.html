                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <P>The name "giraffe" has its earliest known origins in the Arabic word zarāfah (زرافة),
                        perhaps borrowed from the animal's Somali name geri. The Arab name is translated as "fast-walker".
                        In early Modern English the spellings jarraf and ziraph were used, probably directly from the Arabic,
                        and in Middle English orafle and gyrfaunt, gerfaunt. The Italian form giraffa arose in the 1590s.
                        The modern English form developed around 1600 from the French girafe.
                       "Camelopard" /kəˈmɛləˌpɑːrd/ is an archaic English name for giraffes; it derives from the Ancient Greek καμηλοπάρδαλις (kamēlopárdalis),
                        from κάμηλος (kámēlos), "camel", and πάρδαλις (párdalis), "leopard", referring to their camel-like shape and leopard-like colouration.

                  <p>Giraffes (genus Giraffa) are African artiodactyl mammals. They are the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants.
                    Traditionally they are thought to comprise one species, Giraffa camelopardalis,
                    with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to nine extant giraffe species has been described,
                    based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa.
                    Seven other prehistoric species, known from fossils, are extinct.
                    Giraffes' chief distinguishing characteristics are their extremely long neck and legs, their horn-like ossicones,
                    and their distinctive coat patterns. They are classified under the family Giraffidae, along with their closest extant relative, the okapi.
                    Their scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.
                    Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species,
                    which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. 
                    Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring,
                    or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations.
                    Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.
                    Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.
